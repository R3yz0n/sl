# Uploading File Using PHP

## HTML Form (upload.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>File Upload</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Upload File</h2>
    <form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="file" />
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Upload" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

## PHP File Upload Handler (upload.php)

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST" && isset($_FILES["uploadedFile"])) {
    $targetDirectory = "uploads/"; // Specify the directory where you want to save the uploaded files
    $uploadedFile = $_FILES["uploadedFile"]["tmp_name"];
    $destination = $targetDirectory . basename($_FILES["uploadedFile"]["name"]);

    // Check if the file is uploaded successfully
    if (move_uploaded_file($uploadedFile, $destination)) {
        echo "File uploaded successfully.";
    } else {
        echo "Error uploading file.";
    }
}
?>
```
