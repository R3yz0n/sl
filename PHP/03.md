# File handling using PHP

File handling in PHP allows you to read from and write to files on the server's file system. PHP provides various functions for file handling, making it easy to perform operations like reading a file's content, writing data to a file, appending data to a file, and more. Below are some common file handling operations using PHP:

### The file may be opened in the following modes

| Mode | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| r    | Open a file for read only. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file.                                                                                      |
| w    | Open a file for write only. Erases the contents of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file.          |
| a    | Open a file for write only. The existing data in the file is preserved. File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist. |
| x    | Creates a new file for write only. Returns FALSE and an error if the file already exists.                                                                         |
| r+   | Open a file for read/write. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file.                                                                                     |
| w+   | Open a file for read/write. Erases the contents of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file.          |
| a+   | Open a file for read/write. The existing data in the file is preserved. File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist. |
| x+   | Creates a new file for read/write. Returns FALSE and an error if the file already exists.                                                                         |

## Reading a File :

```php
<?php
$filename = "example.txt";

// Open the file in read modeopened in one of the following modes:
$file = fopen($filename, "r");

// Read the file line by line
while (!feof($file)) {
    $line = fgets($file);
    echo $line . "<br>";
}

// Close the file
fclose($file);
?>

```

## Writing to a File :

```php
<?php
$filename = "example.txt";
$data = "This is some content to write to the file.";

// Open the file in write mode
$file = fopen($filename, "w");

// Write the data to the file
fwrite($file, $data);

// Close the file
fclose($file);

echo "Data written to the file.";
?>

```

## Appending to a File :

```php
<?php
$filename = "example.txt";
$data = "This is some additional content to append.";

// Open the file in append mode
$file = fopen($filename, "a");

// Append the data to the file
fwrite($file, $data);

// Close the file
fclose($file);

echo "Data appended to the file.";
?>

```

## Checking if a File Exists :

```php

<?php
$filename = "example.txt";

if (file_exists($filename)) {
    echo "The file exists.";
} else {
    echo "The file does not exist.";
}
?>

```

## Deleting a File :

```php
<?php
$filename = "example.txt";

if (file_exists($filename)) {
    unlink($filename);
    echo "File deleted successfully.";
} else {
    echo "The file does not exist.";
}
?>

```
