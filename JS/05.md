# Client Side Cookies in JS

## 🍪 What are Cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored in the browser of a user. They are used to store information about the user on the client-side. Cookies are sent to the server with every request made by the user. They are used to store information such as user preferences, shopping cart items, etc.

## 🍪 Setting a Cookie

Cookies can be created using the `document.cookie` property. The syntax for creating a cookie is as follows:

```js
document.cookie = "cookieName=cookieValue; expires=expirationDate; path=/";
```

`cookieName`: Replace this with the name you want to give your cookie.
`cookieValue` : Replace this with the value you want to store in your cookie.
`expirationDate`: Replace this with the expiration date of your cookie. If you do not specify an expiration date, the cookie will be deleted when the browser is closed.
`path`: Replace this with the path of your cookie. If you do not specify a path, the cookie will be available for the current page only.

## 🍪 Reading a Cookie

```js
var cookieValue = document.cookie;
```

```js
To update a cookie, simply set it again with the new value or an updated expiration date:

document.cookie = "cookieName=newCookieValue; expires=newExpirationDate; path=/";

```

## 🍪 Deleting a Cookie

```js
document.cookie = "cookieName=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
```

## 🍪 Conclusion

Client-side cookies are useful for storing small amounts of data on a user's browser. They are commonly used for session management, personalization, and tracking user preferences. However, be mindful of potential privacy concerns, especially when dealing with third-party cookies. Always consider the sensitivity of the data stored in cookies and ensure your website complies with privacy regulations.
