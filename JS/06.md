# Function and recursive function using JavaScript.

## Function

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is executed when it is called. Functions are used to organize code into logical blocks, which can then be reused in other parts of the program. Functions can also be passed arguments, which are values that are passed to the function when it is called.

### Defining a Function

A function is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by the name of the function, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in curly braces. The syntax for defining a function is as follows:

```js

function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // function body
}

```

`functionName`: Replace this with the name of your function.
`parameter1`, `parameter2`, ...: Replace these with the parameters of your function. Parameters are optional.
`function body`: Replace this with the code that you want your function to execute.

### Calling a Function

A function is called by using its name followed by a list of arguments enclosed in parentheses. The syntax for calling a function is as follows:

```js

functionName(argument1, argument2, ...);

```

`functionName`: Replace this with the name of your function.
`argument1`, `argument2`, ...: Replace these with the arguments that you want to pass to your function. Arguments are optional.

### Example

Here's an example of how to define and call a function:

```js
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

sayHello("John"); // Output: Hello, John!
```

## Recursive Function

A recursive function is a function that calls itself. It is used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems. Recursive functions are useful for solving problems that involve repetitive tasks, such as sorting algorithms and tree traversal.

### Example

Here's an example of how to define and call a recursive function:

```js
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```
